    <h2>Why Venice?</h2>
    <h3>Venice is the city of canals</h3>
    
    <p>Venice, known also as the “City of Canals,” “The Floating City,” and “Serenissima,” is arguably one of Italy’s most picturesque cities. With its winding canals, striking architecture, and beautiful bridges, Venice is a popular destination for travel.There are 177 canals in Venice. The S-shaped Grand Canal is the biggest and splits the city in two. Venice is known for its bridges. There are 417 bridges in Venice, and 72 of those are private. The San Marco bell tower, or campanile, was built in the 12th century and collapsed in 1902. The tower was rebuilt to be exactly the same as the previous one. It is 98.6 metres tall, making it the fifth tallest bell tower in Italy.
        Venice is sinking at the rate of 1-2 millimeters a year.</p>
    <p>The population of Venice has decreased from 120,000 to 60,000 in the last 50 years. Some experts believe Venice could be a ghost town by 2030 with only tourists visiting by day. The first woman in the world that graduated was born in Venice in 1646. The first public casino in the world was opened in Venice in 1638. There are about 350 gondolas and 400 gondolieri in Venice. On average, gondolas are 11 meters long and weigh around 600 kilos.
        In 1608, the Council of Ten approved wearing masks only during the carnival. Those who broke the law were heavily punished. Punishments ranged from two years in prison to public beating and binding to the pillar of shame. Houses in Venice are numbered according to districts, not streets, making it difficult to find addresses, even for postmen. The rule of thumb is to look for a monument, shop, or landmark in close proximity.

                <h4>Antico Forno</h4>
                <p>Antico Forno makes with no doubts the best pizza in Venice, and is even recognized by some as one of the top 10 pizza places in Italy! The incredible knowledge for this art, the multiple types of doughs, the choice of excellent Italian ingredients, the dedication and care in the making, the number of varieties and the daily amount served are simply impressive. Antico Forno makes great panini as well and offers a nice range of beers, soft drinks and hot wine to go along with their fabulous pizza. If you still need information to be truly convinced, let’s just tell you that one of us worked in front of the Antico Forno for 7 years, and for 7 years he’s been eating every day one whole pizza for lunch! In case you’re wondering, he never got bored nor did he gain weight because of this!</p>

            <p>Rugheta del Ravano, 973 Near Rialto Bridge, 30125 Venice Italy</p>
            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
            <p>A light bite pizza place that sells it by the slice. Great taste, though very much more like a pizza sandwich than a thin Italian slice. They have the pizzas out and you pick a slice to b eat. They oven it and serve. Off you go.</p>
